i discussed the exercise on my self.

=============================
=  README for ex12: Four in a Row =
=============================
==================
=  Description:  =
==================
The game consists of a 6-row and 7-column board and is designed for
two players (for example, red and black)Queue, the player must select
a column to which he inserts a disc - the disc always lands at the bottom,
at the top The stack of disks that have already been inserted into this
column. The game ends when one of the players produces a sequence of four
Discs in color, in any of the possible directions (vertical, horizontal or diagonal).

we implement the game in the exercise in 4 stages:
1. In the first stage we implement the file graphics in the game(GUI).
2. In the second stage we implement the game file.
3. In the third stage we implement the artificial intelligence (AI) file.
4. In the fourth stage we implement the other files that responsible for additional things.

and we divide our code to functions on this way.

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
we used in this exercize 5 files:
1)game.py:
in the first ,we implement the game.py file that responsible for the game setting
and how to play agame with the correct rules as they asked for the exercize.

2)gui.py:
in this file we implement the graphics of the game and the bottons that in the game
and the bootons that we need to use in the game.

3)ai.py:
in this file we implement the artificial intelligence and we implement that
we can to play whith the computer and we add the right botton in the right
place in the menu.

4)four_in_a_row.py:
in this file we add the main func that responsible for runnig the game and
play it properly.
